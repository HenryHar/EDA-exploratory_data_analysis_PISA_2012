# EDA-explotarotry_data_analysis_PISA_2012

This repo contains an exploratory data analysis I conducted on the 2012 PISA (programme for international student assessment) test scores.

The point of this project was to explore a large dataset and visualize some of the variables to gain more insights. 

I wanted to investigate the following relationships :

*test scores for Math, Reading and Science vs Country
*test scores for Math, Reading and Science vs OECD/NON-OECD countries 
*test scores for Math, Reading and Science vs Gender (Male/Female)
*test scores for Math, Reading and Science vs OECD/NON-OECD vs Females/Males
*learning time Minutes per week vs Test Scores
*learning time Minutes per week vs Test Scores on a country by country basis

All of these relationships are explored in 'exploration_PISA_Henry.ipynb'. The notebook file first explores every variable independently and then proceeds to the bivariate and multivariate explorations.

Finally, I also created a summary notebook 'explanatory_results.ipynb' and if you clone the repo you can view these in a slide format similar to how Microsoft Powerpoint works.
